    \title Testing your plugin
    \brief This page describes how to test your plugin that you've just created

    In order to make guhd load your plugin, you have 2 options. Either install it into the system or make guhd load it from your plugin build directory.

    To install the plugin into the system, run
    \code
        $ make install
    \endcode

    To make guhd load the plugin from the plugins build directory, run guhd with an environment variable exported
    \code
        $ GUH_PLUGINS_DIR=/path/to/plugin/ guhd
    \endcode

    In order to easier debug things, it is advised to enable debug output for the device manager and your plugin. E.g.
    \code
        $ GUH_PLUGINS_DIR=/path/to/plugin guhd -d DeviceManager,YourPlugin
    \endcode
